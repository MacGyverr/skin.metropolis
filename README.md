# skin.metropolis
Metropolis skin for Kodi 17 (Krypton)

Just some very ugly edits to get the skin to simply run under Krypton.

Proper updates will come later.  If something is broken, I most likely know about it already, but let me know anyway just in case.
(remember that the d/l zip won't install, it will need to be unzipped to a folder named "skin.metropolis" and re-zipped into a metropolis.zip file, then Kodi should let you install the zip.)
